📚 How it works
Users sign up and get a unique referral code they can share.

When a referred friend registers or buys a product, the referrer earns points.

Users can view transactions, orders, team members, and course progress on their dashboard.

Admin can track purchases and user activities.

This project demonstrates key principles of modern web application development like secure authentication, relational data modeling (teams, orders, transactions), and an integrated user experience.
